Long gone are the days of keyword stuffing and gaming the system. SEO today is looking more and more like effective content marketing. Build for your users, and the spiders will be happy, too.

At its core, an effective SEO strategy consists of two branches: on-page data, and off-site relationships.

Dialing in on the first is easier: there are specific tactics, tools and development processes which meet the industry‚Äôs quality specs. These range from simpler (title tags, server settings...) to more involved (keyword optimized content, site speed). The key here is to implement tactics that provide the greatest return first, then follow up with additional optimizations as needed. Although it‚Äôs more efficient to introduce these elements earlier in the development process than it is to retrofit after the fact, it‚Äôs also true that starting the process now can still produce verifiable results quickly.

The second branch, managing off-site relationships, requires long-term planning and consistent execution. While nurturing strategic linked content takes time and effort, it pays off twice: your market receives greater brand exposure in relevant online media, while search engines obtain direct signals regarding your site‚Äôs authority in its field. The technical description for this effect is known as ‚Äúwin/win‚Äù. üôÇ

Getting SEO right requires the dedication of people across the team. Product managers, content producers, and developers all have a major impact. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to get the right tools in place and support each person in the mix.
